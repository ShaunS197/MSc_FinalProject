## Data origins 
The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) is a continuous, cross-sectional survey that began fieldwork in the year 2008. The survey is carried out by three organisations - the National Centre for Social Research, MRC Human Nutrition Research (HNR), and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University College London Medical School (UCL). The survey was designed to collect information that is representative of the UK population. Gathered data include information concerning patterns of food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status of the general population aged 1.5 years and older living in private households in the UK. Documentation, including instructions and coding information for years 1 to 11 can be found here (https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6533#!/documentation). 
Data from Wave 1 to Wave 6 of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) [2008-2019] was used for the purpose of this study. This dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via this link (https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6533). The data for all six years were accessed on the 5th of July, 2023.
